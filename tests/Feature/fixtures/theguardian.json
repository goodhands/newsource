No, Delap will spearhead Chelsea’s attack with Joao Pedro behind him in the No10 role, while Enzo Fernandez drops further back.

Following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/02/wolves-sack-vitor-pereira-premier-league\">the dismissal of Vitor Pereira</a> last Sunday, their Under-21s coach James Collins will take interim charge of today’s game, assisted by his Under-18s counterpart James Walker.</p> <p>Rob Edwards continues to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/07/rob-edwards-link-with-wolves-reignited-after-not-taking-middlesbrough-training\">linked with the vacant position at Molineux</a>. His current employers Middlesbrough rejected an approach for his services from Wolves on Thursday but have resigned themselves to losing him and granted him permission to speak to the Molineux hierarchy. A former Wolves player, Edwards was not present to take Boro training yesterday and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/08/rob-edwards-middlesbrough-stand-down-manager-wolves-move-football-premier-league\">stood down by the club</a> for this afternoon’s win over Birmingham City. Only time will tell whether his apprently inevitable arrival at Wolves is a step up, down or sideways for the 42-year-old who already has one relegation from the Premier League on his CV.</p> <p>Today’s match could be a baptism of fire for Collins, who has previously worked as the club’s assistant coach under Julen Lopetegui. He takes a demoralised team to Stamford Bridge to go toe-to-toe with a Chelsea side who thrashed Tottenham in as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/01/tottenham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">emphatic a 1-0 win</a> as you will ever see last weekend, before being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/05/qarabag-chelsea-champions-league-match-report\">held by Qarabag</a> in their midweek Champions League assignment in Baku.

Vicky Pattison’s Strictly playlist has been heavy on the pop divas, with Madonna, Bonnie Tyler and Cheryl in recent weeks. Queens all. She’s been the field’s steadiest improver in terms of scores, with last week the first time that she didn’t increase her total. But she’s consistently getting eights now and has become a fixture in mid-table. Kai Widdrington said this week that he thought the tango was her best ballroom dance yet and he might just be right. Flat and fierce in close hold. Regal mood. Slow, stalking promenades with sharp swivels and and clipped staccato. Footwork a little hurried in a couple of places but excellent characterisation and real fire. Loved that. </p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>The Fate of Ophelia by Taylor Swift. The lead single from her recent album, The Life Of A Showgirl, is a synth-pop banger inspired by the doomed, drowned Hamlet character. It broke global records for the most-streamed song on Spotify. The lyrics include references to Swift’s relationship with fiancé Travis Kelce, portraying him as an honourable man who saved her from heartbreak and tragedy.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T19:42:38.422Z\">at 7.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-690f9b8b8f08c6fafc4616ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T19:37:53.345Z\">7.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Judges’ scores: </strong>9, 10, 9, 10 for a total of 38 points.

All about connection with her partner Nikita Kuzmin. She needs to let herself go to nail the spicy Cuban vibe and energy. Started in a lift, which is unusual, then into a sparkly disco salsa with changes of rhythm. Fast and flirty. She’s been scoring consistently in the mid-30s. Can she start turning those eights and nines into her first 10? Spinning headbanger lift, lacks a little hip action and Latin spice but undoubtedly accomplished and another lift to finish. </p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) by Sylvester. The 1978 disco classic and Hi-NRG gay anthem was later covered by Jimmy Somerville and Byron Stingily, whose versions charted in 1989 and 1997 respectively.

Spinning rotation and buttery smooth as they twirl around the floor. This is more like it. Footwork falters in patches but romantic mood and lovely movement. Enjoyed that.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Somebody to Love by Queen. The 1976, Aretha Franklin-inspired anthem layered the vocals of Freddie Mercury, Brian May and Roger Taylor to create the impression of a 100-strong gospel choir.

Can she maintain momentum while going from power to softness? She hasn’t done ballroom for four weeks but the foxtrot is partner Aljaž Škorjanec’s favourite dance. Lying down on the dancefloor to start. Woodstock hippy vibes in a shimmery rainbow frock. Gliding, flowing and fluid. Topline wobbles and posture not perfect with the odd bit of gapping. Lacks a little smoothness but petals fall and high performance value as always. Lovely. </p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Make Your Own Kind of Music by Cass Elliot. The 1969 bubblegum pop anthem by Mama Cass featured prominently in plane crash drama Lost. It was later covered by Paloma Faith of “murdered in plain sight by Alan Carr on The Celebrity Traitors” fame *touches face with poison pollen*.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-690f922f8f087353b0fc5c5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T18:57:54.458Z\">6.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Judges’ scores: </strong>7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points.

Now she and pro partner Johannes Radebe are telling the story of the bullfight, clad in black lacy outfits. Imperious characterisation. Packed with content and traditional steps. Great chemistry. Fiery and passionate, as you’d expect from an actor who always brings the drama. She’s been working hard in training on that contorted banana shape but those curved Spanish lines are a little lacking. Flat-footed at times but powerful and punchy. A high-class paso, if not a spicy one. </p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Amparito Roca by Jaime Teixidor. The famous 1925 piece, named after one of the composer’s 12-year-old piano students. McFly’s Tom Fletcher and Amy Dowden also performed a paso to it during the 2021 series.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-690f90128f087353b0fc5c4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T18:48:01.092Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Judges’ scores: </strong>8, 10 (woah!), 8, 9 for a total of 35 points.

Former Lioness Karen Carney, riding high after scorting her first 10s for last week’s Peaky Blinders-capped Argentine tango, should have the sporty stamina and fast feet required here. Her pro partner Carlos Gu’s previous Charlestons have scored 35 and 38 points. No pressure. Gimmicky upside-down opening, then into a quirky, happy dance packed with lifts, tricks, flicks and kicks. Loads of steps and bounce. Cute outfits, with Karen in “skorts”, braces and blouse. Craig “Swivel” Horwood will have a beady eye on those ankles. Out of sync at times and a little messy in the upper body. Giving it welly, fast as hell but not quite gellling for me.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Upside Down/Think by Diana Ross/Aretha Franklin. A funky mash-up of the Niles Rodgers-produced 1980 disco classic and the 1968 soul anthem which was famously featured on The Blues Brothers soundtrack.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T20:59:13.641Z\">at 8.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-690f8dea8f082a7322259968\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T18:39:18.389Z\">6.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Judges’ scores: </strong>8, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points.

Last week’s triumphant Couple’ Choice scored a perfect 40 (only the second ever maximum for pro partner Katya Jones) and was hailed as one of the best dances in Strictly history. A lot to live up to, so the technically tricky Cuban party dance could see Lewis come crashing back to earth – or perhaps not. Lots of exposing solo work which he handles with style. Low, deep and grounded down below. More fluid and free in the upper body. Cheeky, flirty feel with wiggling hip action. A large helping of Cuban sauce. Man, he’s good. Katya clearly loving having a great partner. Phew, a spicy start to the show.</p> <p><strong>Song:</strong> I Like It Like That by Pete Rodriguez. The 1967 boogaloo hit was covered in the 90s by Latin supergroup The Blackout All-Stars version. Its use in a Burger King ad also contributed to its resurgence in popularity, More recently, it was sampled by rapper Cardi B (full name: Cardigan Buttons).</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T18:37:15.223Z\">at 6.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-690f8c078f082a7322259955\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T18:31:13.673Z\">6.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Our Strictly stars™</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our couples come out for a staircase welcome wave.

It is contaminated plastic. Marine animals will ingest small plastic items once they are in the sea, they will attract algae, they will smell like food, effectively.</p> <p>“Once they’ve eaten it, that’s it: they can’t get it out. They will float on the surface. It will create a slick which attracts plunging seabirds.”</p> <p>He said the clean-up efforts have been exhausting. “Yesterday I was out there cleaning it up. We are trying to really piece together the timeline and the story for this horrendous event. It’s terrible.</p>    <p>“They are so small that from a very long way off, the beach looks normal. But as soon as you get close up you see there are millions of black pellets, nestled under seaweed. It’s an impossible task – volunteers have been raking for days, and they will continue to rake, but we won’t be able to get rid of them all. It is the worst I have ever seen of a polluted beach.”</p> <p>Dollimore, the Labour and Co-operative MP who joined the clean-up efforts, said: “The huge number of plastic beads that have washed up here risks an environmental catastrophe. These biobeads are deadly to marine life and wildlife, and we are already seeing more dead seals, fish and porpoises on the beach.</p> <p>“Local residents are working tirelessly to remove as many beads as possible, but it’s a race against time. Southern Water must urgently establish if their local wastewater plants could be the source of these biobeads, and I’ve asked them to dedicate all available resources to supporting the clean-up operation in the meantime.”</p> <p>The beads are also dangerous to dogs as they contain a high number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are known to have carcinogenic properties, and they often contain toxins including lead, antimony and bromine.</p> <p>A Southern Water spokesperson said: “We are working closely with the Environment Agency and Rother district council to investigate the source of plastic beads which have washed up on Camber Beach. This investigation work is ongoing.</p> <p>“Rother district council is leading the clean-up of the beach, using specialists with a vehicle with suction equipment to remove the beads. We are also supporting with the clean-up.</p> <p>“We’ve conducted water-quality sampling on the beach, which has shown no impact to environmental water quality. This data has been shared with Rother district council and the Environment Agency.”</p> <p>An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We are aware that a large number of plastic nurdles have washed up along a stretch of coastline in East Sussex which includes Camber Sands.</p> <p>“We are providing advice and guidance to Rother district council, which has employed contractors to carry out a clean-up operation. This work is currently under way.</p> <p>“We are working with other responders to identify the source of the pollution.”</p>",

While some may think it’s too soon to bust out the twinkly lights and tinsel, I love the winter holiday season so much that my Thanksgiving dinner isn’t complete without a fully bedecked Douglas fir and soft jazz in the background.</p> <p>If you also savor the season – or know someone who does – Advent calendars are a fun way to elevate every day with a new surprise, whether that’s an exotic new coffee to start the day, a sweet treat for the afternoon, or a premixed nightcap to wind down with. As a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas\">yuletide</a> aficionado, I’ve tried plenty over the years, and these are some of my favorites for adults, kids – and kids at heart.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best advent calendars in the US for 2025</h2> <h2>Edible treats</h2>    <h2>Bonne Maman 2025 Limited Edition Advent Calendar</h2>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://store.moma.org/products/2025-bonne-maman-advent-calendar\" > $49.99 at MoMA Design Store </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.worldmarket.com/p/bonne-maman-fruit-spreads-and-honey-advent-calendar-549359.html\" > $49.99 at World Market </a>  <p>As a devotee to Bonne Maman’s extraordinary strawberry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/feb/09/beginners-guide-making-delicious-jam-10-easy-steps\">jam</a>, I look forward to this Advent calendar every year. The included 24 spreads range in flavors including fig and cardamom, Italian mandarin, plum and pear, raspberry and lychee, and milk caramel – just to name a few. Each 1oz (28g) jar is more than enough for a few pieces of toast or stirring into plain yogurt, brightening up breakfast all month long.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>See’s Candy Advent Calendar</h2>    <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sees.com/pre-order/2025-advent-calendar/201547.html\" > $80 at See’s Candies </a>  <p>Receiving a classic See’s Candies assortment has always been a special treat in my household, and this calendar is no different. It features 24 different selections from See’s vast catalog of confections, from cashew brittle to dark chocolate scotchmallows, and peanut nougat to dark chocolate salted caramel. Impressively high-quality but still reasonably priced, it is sure to thrill all ages of chocolate lovers.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Dandelion Chocolate 2025 Advent Calendar</h2>    <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.dandelionchocolate.com/products/advent-calendar?\" > $328 at Dandelion Chocolate </a>  <p>This luxurious, lunar-themed advent calendar from San Francisco’s Dandelion Chocolate contains 25 varieties of handcrafted artisan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/chocolate\">chocolates</a> from across North America.

They were minutes away from their 11th consecutive win in all competitions … but then Brian Brobbey popped up to secure a point for newly promoted Sunderland, who are now third in the table! The Black Cats are obviously delighted, and celebrate a deserved draw after a game of great ebb and flow: Sunderland were the better team in a battling first half, Arsenal showed their title credentials to turn the scoreline around in style, but went too defensive during the last knockings and paid the price against a team who seized the day. Dan Ballard was named player of the match, and deservedly so, having scored a fine goal, set up the other, and blocked what looked a certain winner right at the death. That’s was fine evening’s entertainment, though Arsenal won’t be feeling too chipper about their being a part of it right now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/100/top\"> <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table table--football table--striped\"> <thead> <tr> <th class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\"><abbr title=\"Position\">Pos</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Team</th> <th class=\"football-stat--played\"><abbr title=\"Played\">P</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--difference\"><abbr title=\"Goal difference\">GD</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--points\"><abbr title=\"Points\">Pts</abbr></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">1</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Arsenal</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">11</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">15</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">26</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man City</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">10</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">12</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">19</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Sunderland</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">11</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">19</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Tottenham Hotspur</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">11</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">9</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">18</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Liverpool</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">10</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">18</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T19:49:29.722Z\">at 7.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-690f9ba08f08c6fafc461700\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T19:36:58.214Z\">7.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: Sunderland 2-2 Arsenal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Arsenal concede twice for the first time this season, Sunderland earning a deserved draw in dramatic fashion!</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T19:41:39.070Z\">at 7.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-690f9b698f087353b0fc5cb3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T19:35:58.238Z\">7.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min +8:</strong> … and then Talbi nearly takes advantage of a Rice slip to tear clear on goal, but the Arsenal man recovers his poise just in time.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-690f9b018f087353b0fc5cb1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-11-08T19:35:01.400Z\">7.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min +7:</strong> That old Roker Roar fairly crackled the atmosphere.

The last time they met in the Premier League, in 2016-17, Arsenal won 2-0 at home and 4-1 at the Stadium of Light. Arsenal are on a 15-game unbeaten streak against Sunderland in the League that stretches back to 2009, while the last time they lost any game against them was in the FA Cup in 2012. History is not on Sunderland’s side this evening.<sup>†</sup></p> <p><strong>The recent form book doesn’t help them either, though that’s only because Arsenal right now are on the hottest streak in the country, in Europe, in the world.</strong> The Premier League leaders are currently on a run of ten consecutive wins in all competitions, and eight consecutive clean sheets. Who can compete with numbers like that?! In fact, Sunderland’s own recent form is highly impressive: five Premier League wins already, and unbeaten at home, commendable business for a freshly promoted team. And hey, <em>someone</em> has to score against Arsenal at some point, right? Eh?</p> <p><strong>So there is hope for Sunderland …</strong> and we’ve not even priced in the presence in their team of former Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka, who is a headline waiting to happen tonight, one way or another. You know how football goes sometimes. Arsenal are hot favourites, but Sunderland are unlikely to go down without a fight. <strong>Kick-off is at 5.30pm GMT.</strong> It’s on!</p> <p><sup>†: To be fair, Sunderland did beat Arsenal in the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1973, en route to their greatest triumph in the modern era. So there is that. But let’s not cloud the issue.</sup></p> </div>   </div>",

                    "body": "<p>The former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson has died after a short illness, his family said on Saturday. He was 68.</p> <p>The television presenter and motoring journalist died “peacefully surrounded by his family”, a statement said.</p> <p>Willson was one of the first hosts on the BBC motoring show, alongside Jeremy Clarkson, before he went on to front the Channel 5 programme Fifth Gear.</p> <p>He hosted Top Gear from 1991 until 2001 and went on to create and present shows including Britain’s Worst Drivers and BBC Two’s The Car’s the Star.</p> <p>The statement said: “A true national treasure, Quentin brought the joy of motoring, from combustion to electric, into our living rooms.”</p> <p>The broadcaster was an avid consumer champion, advocating for a number of campaigns including helping to freeze fuel duty with his FairFuel campaign and recently worked to make electric vehicles affordable through his <a href=\"https://www.faircharge.co.uk/\">FairCharge campaign</a>.</p> <p>In April, he criticised the government for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/apr/22/british-motorists-save-electric-car-hybrid\">changing EV rules</a> to allow more sales of cars with petrol and diesel engines until 2035, describing it as a “grave misstep”.</p> <p>The family statement added: “Long before it was fashionable, he championed the GM EV1 and the promise of electric cars, proving he was always ahead of the curve.</p> <p>“Much-loved husband to Michaela, devoted father to Mercedes, Max and Mini, and cherished grandfather to Saskia, Xander and Roxana. Quentin will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and all who knew him personally and professionally.</p> <p>“The void he has left can never be filled. His knowledge was not just learned but lived; a library of experience now beyond our reach.”</p> <p>The former Top Gear presenter James May, who appeared alongside Willson on the programme, described him as a “great bloke”. He added: “Quentin Willson gave me proper advice and encouragement during my earliest attempts at TV, back in the late 90s. I’ve never forgotten it.”</p> <p>Willson, who was born in Leicester, wrote weekly columns for the Mirror and Sunday Mirror for 15 years and contributed to Classic Cars magazine. He was named motoring writer of the year at the British Press Awards in 2004.</p>    <p>Willson also made headlines after performing on Strictly Come Dancing in 2004 where he continues to hold the lowest score in the show’s history after receiving an eight for his cha-cha-cha with Hazel Newberry.</p> <p>Ginny Buckley, chief executive of the EV advice site Electrifying.com, said: “Quentin was a true national treasure. I was lucky to get to know him in recent years through his excellent work with FairCharge, where his passion for making electric vehicles accessible to all really shone through.</p> <p>“He was warm, generous with his knowledge and unfailingly kind. He brought the joy of motoring – from petrol to plug – into our homes and hearts, and will be greatly missed.”</p> <p>Lawrence Whittaker, owner of the racing car manufacturer Lister Cars, also paid tribute and wrote on X: “He was the architect of the Warrantywise plan and revolutionised not just the car warranty market but, through his campaigning and journalism, made the entire UK motor trade a better place.</p> <p>“He was the most knowledgeable [sic] person I ever met when it came to cars and was such a pro in front of and behind the camera. We worked closely together for over 10 years and my thoughts go out to his wife and family at this difficult time. He will be sorely missed by all.</p> <p>“God speed Q! You will be missed.”</p>",

                    "body": "<p> Another win for England, their ninth in succession, but comfortable was definitely not the word for it. Only in the final quarter did the home side pull away on the scoreboard and, for lengthy periods, they had to work extremely hard for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/01/england-australia-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report\">second victory</a> in as many weeks.<strong> </strong>They will definitely need to find another gear to see off next Saturday’s opponents New Zealand.</p> \n<p>Equally there is no doubting the fact England are finishing games more strongly and have some rare talent lurking in reserve. This time it was their birthday boy, Henry Arundell, who shone brightest off the bench, scoring one scorching try and looking dangerous every time he touched the ball on his first appearance for England for two years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/08/england-v-fiji-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-live\">England 38-18 Fiji: Autumn Nations Series rugby union – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was also a good night to be English and hyphenated. Chandler Cunningham-South, Manny Feyi-Waboso and Luke Cowan-Dickie all had forceful games, with the latter pair claiming two of their side’s six tries. On a calm, mild evening in south-west London – not that the palm trees in Twickenham high street ever sway too wildly – Ollie Chessum was also prominently involved while Ellis Genge led purposefully from the front.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eee8d7eb-a927-4814-bbbc-75a648c91531\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England&nbsp;</b>M Smith; Freeman (Arundell 66), Lawrence, Dingwall, Feyi-Waboso; F Smith, Mitchell (Spencer 62); Genge (co-capt; Baxter 53), Cowan-Dickie (George 53), Heyes (Opoku-Fordjour 53), Coles (Itoje; co-capt 53), Chessum, Pepper (Pollock 53), Earl, Cunningham-South (T Curry 53).&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Tries:&nbsp;</b>Cowan-Dickie, Feyi-Waboso, Genge, George, Arundell, Itoje.&nbsp;<b>Cons&nbsp;</b>F Smith 4.</p>\n    <p><b>Fiji&nbsp;</b>Rayasi; Ravutaumada, Ravouvou, Tuisova, Wainiqolo (Maqala 56); Muntz (Armstrong-Ravula 59), Kuruvoli (Wye 66); Mawi (Hetet 56), Ikanivere (capt; Togiatama 56), Doge (Tawake 56), Nasilasila (Vocevoce 65), Mayanavanua, Salawa, Canakaivata (Murray 61), Mata.</p>\n    <p><b>Yellow cards</b>&nbsp;Ravutaumada 35, Tuisova 59.</p>\n    <p><b>Tries&nbsp;</b>Ikanivere 2, Muntz.&nbsp;<b>Pen&nbsp;</b>Muntz.</p>\n    <p><b>Referee&nbsp;</b>Paul Williams (NZ).</p>\n    <p><b>Att</b> 78,678.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But rather like the pre-game minute’s silence, which was interspersed with a persistent automatic tannoy message blasting out of the stadium’s bowels, it was ultimately a mixed bag from an English perspective. This was a game they had earmarked as a chance for some experimentation but the physicality of a gallant Fiji side rudely interrupted some of Steve Borthwick’s best-laid plans, not least the search for his ideal backline blend.</p> \n<p>There is little doubt George Ford will get the nod at 10 against New Zealand but, as with the All Blacks and the talented duo of Beauden Barrett and Damian McKenzie, Steve Borthwick still has one or two conundrums to solve. Fraser Dingwall and Ollie Lawrence were not always in perfect harmony in England’s midfield while Arundell’s electric contribution will reopen the debate about the future shape of the back three. Freddie Steward is fit again but the Bath flyer may yet emerge as a better long-term starting option at 15 than the versatile Marcus Smith.</p> \n<p>It all made for a thought-provoking evening with Fiji again doing themselves proud. Replicating their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/26/england-fiji-rugby-union-match-report\">famous win in this stadium</a> in August 2023 was never going to be easy but, after an early score for a charging Cowan-Dickie, the visitors built some impressive first-half momentum.<strong> </strong>First a well-engineered rolling maul produced a try for the skipper Tevita Ikanivere and England then fell victim to one of those uniquely unplayable Fijian attacks that remain their hallmark.</p> \n<p>There had already been some glorious passing before the scrum-half Simione Kuruvoli chipped the English defence and was taken down without the ball by Marcus Smith. In the event Fiji did not need the advantage, Caleb Muntz gathering the bouncing ball and just reaching the line despite Ben Earl’s desperate tackle.</p> \n<p>With a subsequent penalty by Muntz extending the visitors’ lead to 13-7 just before the half-hour mark, Fiji simply needed to keep calm and carry on. It was less than ideal, then, when the winger Selestino Ravutaumada was given a yellow card for clattering Feyi-Waboso in the air and England took swift advantage of their extra man when Fin Smith lobbed a cross-kick to an unmarked Feyi-Waboso who cut inside to score. Smith’s conversion restored the red rose lead and settled a few fluttering home nerves.</p> \n<p>Ellis Genge’s 49th-minute try, rewarding a multi-phase attack, fell into the same category and extended England’s lead to 21-13. Fiji, though, stick in games for much longer these days. Six of the pack, plus all their forward replacements, play Super Rugby for the Fijian Drua and one of them, Ikanivere, plunged over for his second try after a crafty front-of-the-lineout ploy.</p> \n<p>Only Muntz’s recurring failure to land a conversion prevented the scoreboard gap from narrowing further, while a yellow card for the formidable Josua Tuisova was another untimely blow. England were lucky, though, that a quite brilliant 50-metre team score by Fiji was ultimately ruled out for the smallest of knock-ons by a sliding Kuruvoli, which the Fiji coach Mick Byrne felt could have been awarded.</p> \n<p>Instead it was the hosts who finished the stronger, helped by a stunning burst of pace from Arundell who surged past a startled Kalaveti Ravouvou to collect a Marcus Smith kick and celebrate his 23rd birthday in style. His exile in the French Top 14 has ruled him out of England contention for the last season and a half but he has now reminded everyone exactly what he can do. Maro Itoje, another influential second-half arrival,<strong> </strong>applied the icing with England’s sixth try but the All Blacks, as ever, will present the ultimate autumn Test.</p>",

How lovely they can look due to the changes and natural developments, before the inevitable atrophying dumps of loads of mess all over the place that you must spend weeks clearing up in a foul mood. And it’s started raining.</p> <p>Steve Borthwick will powerfully wish to change this picture and it’s started OK for him. The opening win over Australia in this year’s November is already better than 2024, when three miserable losses were punctuated by a bog-standard win over Japan as the full stop in the final week. Much was made amidst the post-series malaise that the opening trio of NZ, Australia and Boks meant the fixtures were front loaded to a fault, with a momentum of misery accompanying each week’s result. In 2025 lessons have been learned, with the win over the Wallabies followed with today’s outing against Fiji as a chance to consolidate the positive vibes.</p> <p>It’s a much changed England team from last week, which given the class sprinkled throughout the Fiji squad could be be seen as hubris from Borthwick. But, while the islanders are no mugs by any measure, they are perennial strugglers in this fixture. A win in the 2023 World Cup warm up games their solitary victory in nine tests vs today’s opposition.</p> <p>England are also arguably the best team in the world at despatching teams they should not struggle against; they remain the only side undefeated by Italy in the Six Nations for example, and rarely lose to tier two opponents. </p> </div>   </div>",

                    "body": "<p>Time is the enemy of all modern managers. There simply isn’t enough of it. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/05/crystal-palace-charged-by-fa-over-fan-banner-nottingham-forest-owner-evangelos-marinakis\">calendar is too packed</a>, the demands on players too great and, just because there is something almost hypocritical about managers moaning about the number of games they have to play when the fixture list is a direct result of the greed of the clubs they work for, that doesn’t mean their fundamental point is not a valid one.</p> <p>Transition is always difficult, particularly when it involves not only a change of players but of style. Arsenal may have brought in more players than Liverpool this summer, but it would require a particular obtuseness to think that bolstering and finessing a system that already fundamentally works is a source of greater disruption than implementing an almost entirely new style.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/08/silence-over-sudan-manchester-city-owners-football\">Silence over Sudan: why do Manchester City’s owners get away with so much?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But transition has been made harder by the fact that time available on the training pitch has been so diminished: little wonder an increasing number of managers are preferring to focus on set plays as a way of maximising the limited opportunity they have to work with their teams.</p> <p>Arsenal went into the weekend six points clear of Manchester City and seven of Liverpool. They look settled in their style, fluent and confident, with a squad deep enough to ride out all but the severest of injury crises. Their two obvious rivals, meanwhile, are trying to implement a new way of playing.</p> <p>An interview Pep Guardiola gave to TNT in January seems increasingly important in outlining how he saw the future of football. “Today,” he said, “modern football is not positional, you have to ride the rhythm. It is unbelievable, and we could not, simply we could not [play in a positional way] because we did not have the players.</p> <p>“The teams that are playing once a week, it is another story and that doesn’t count. It counts when you are playing every three or four days. Injuries happen, but not this amount in certain positions and this amount of important players, it has never happened before.”</p> <p>Squads have to be bigger. Managers have to rotate more. Without time to devise and implement tactical schemes for every fixture, football has to be simplified. The game’s administrators, in expanding competitions, producing ever more content, increasing the demands on elite players, have actively changed how the game is played; it’s fairly evident Guardiola would see that change as being for the worse.</p>    <p>Never before, not even in the four years when he had Lionel Messi in his side at Barcelona, has Guardiola focused his play so much on one player. After overhauling his squad since January, everything is geared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/02/manchester-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">creating chances for Erling Haaland</a>, who has scored a preposterous 27 goals in 17 games for club and country this season.</p> <p>City’s leading scorer in the league this season after Haaland is Maxime Estève, who scored two own goals in City’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/27/manchester-city-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">5-1 win over Burnley</a> in September. Once Guardiola would demand his side played 15 or 20 passes to deal with a potential counter before launching an attack; now everything is about trying to play Haaland in quickly behind the opposing defensive line.</p> <p>There’s something almost passive-aggressive about the switch: “Look at what you’re making me do,” Guardiola seems to be saying, the great overthinker casting aside his complex diagrams and schema for a radical simplification of football, refining the game to its most basic form: goalscorer scores goals.</p> <p>But this is Guardiola, so nothing is ever quite that simple. Although the shape tends to be a 4-3-3, Phil Foden is habitually the most advanced midfielder, whether operating centrally or drifting in from the right. Rayan Cherki fulfilled a similar role <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/02/manchester-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">against Bournemouth last week</a>. Opposing defences, terrified of Haaland hitting space behind them, often drop off, and that creates an area in which intelligent creators can prosper – often by feeding Haaland. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/05/manchester-city-borussia-dortmund-champions-league-report\">Foden scored twice against Borussia Dortmund</a> on Wednesday but he had quietly been having an excellent season even before that, returning to something like his best after a frustrating 2024-25.</p> <p>Arne Slot has been through a similar process. Having brought in only Federico Chiesa for last season, Liverpool’s squad required a refresh for this one. But Slot has acknowledged that he felt other sides had worked his team out by the end of the title-winning campaign and so has attempted something more ambitious than simple rejuvenation.</p> <p>How that is eventually supposed to look is, frankly, a little unclear but it’s notable that the two wins that followed the run of six defeats in seven games have come after a return to something much closer to last season’s approach (and after selecting an extremely inexperienced side in the Carabao Cup, creating a little space in the calendar by in effect giving up on that competition).</p> <p>The Liverpool XI against Aston Villa last Saturday featured 10 players who were at the club last season, plus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/hugo-ekitike-attributes-to-thrive-at-liverpool\">Hugo Ekitiké</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/04/arne-slot-liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-manchester-city-premier-league\">Against Real Madrid on Wednesday</a>, Florian Wirtz was added on the left, replacing Cody Gakpo. The sense was of Slot going back to basics, slowly evolving rather than attempting wholesale revolution. When time is limited, all that is possible is incremental change.</p>    <p>Neither Villa nor Madrid took the approach that has so unsettled Liverpool this season, going long and trying to exploit the space behind the full-backs. When they meet at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, the directness of City’s approach will be a gauge of how committed Guardiola is to his new pragmatism and, if they do try to exploit a vulnerability about which Slot has been open, that will be an indication of whether Liverpool really have stabilised or if these last two wins have been the result of playing sides whose strengths could not disguise their weaknesses.</p> <p>The likelihood is of a Liverpool closely resembling the side of last season, overhaul temporarily paused, versus a Guardiola side playing against type (or at least type as it was in every season up till this one) and trying to exploit the power and pace of their centre-forward, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/21/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">as they did at Arsenal</a>. It’s an unexpected turn of events, one caused largely by the fixture list.</p> <p>Mikel Arteta has already overseen his transition. As Liverpool and City go through theirs, as they face each other knowing defeat would be a grievous blow to their title hopes, time has rarely felt so squeezed.</p>",
